# ⚝ | What is Assorion Engine?

Assorion Engine is a simple and minimal Friday Night Funkin' engine with a focus having the tiniest and easiest to mod source code possible in a HaxeFlixel-based engine.
Every source file has had work done to it, so the code will look completely different to the base game source code.

The main goal is to create a dynamic and malleable codebase, where making big changes will not cause (m)any unintended side effects.
As such, Assorion Engine doesn't have many features that are standard for other engines; Things such as Discord RPC, cutscenes, or mods folder capabilities. Since said features are often not used in every mod released, it makes more sense to only implement what a specific mod requires.

## ⚡ | Why choose Assorion Engine?

**1. Clearer variable names:**  
Assorion Engine has more verbose variable and function names, making it easier to understand what the code is doing.
The engine also uses "camel case" for every variable, function, and even the assets, making it more consistent.

**2. Compact logic:**  
Assorion really only has the code to acheive the bare minimum (+ the Assorion UI Layer). Thus it's code is easily moddable/replacable. On it's own it doesn't really do much at all. But the idea is to get out of the way, in order to make ambitious changes as easy as possible.

**3. Easier to compile:**  
Assorion Engine is very lenient when it comes to compiling. There are only 3 dependiences (4 if HXCPP is counted) which
the engine needs to compile. The game will also compile with all versions of Haxe 4, and Flixel 4.9.0 onwards.

**4. Less hacky:**  
Assorion Engine tries to stay as far away from weird, unintuitive, and hacky language features. Haxe may be a powerful programming language with a lot to offer, but using said features is not mandatory. It often makes the code far harder to understand and debug (especially for people getting started in programming).

# 🗒️ | Important Notes

- Assorion Engine is based off <a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/releases/tag/v0.2.6">`0.2.6`</a> version of the base game, though has been radically altered
- Assorion's chart editor has been completely overhauled
- Assorion allows skipping most transitions by hitting enter twice
- Botplay does not count scoring or health. This is intentional to stop cheating
- Chart speed will change depending on BPM; This is a known early bug that will never be fixed
- Ratings (E:G Sick or Bad), losing and gaining health, and menu positions are inaccurate to the base game
- Porting other mods is very hard. Charts, characters, and weeks are handled much differently
- The players in a song are handled dynamically, and are not hardcoded to Opponent, BF, GF.

# 🛠 | Compiling

#### **For Windows:**
- Install <a href="https://haxe.org/">`Haxe`</a>
- Run `haxelib setup` in a command-prompt window (CMD). Using the default path is fine
- Install [libraries](#libraries) below
- Clone/Download the source code
- Install a C++ compiler. In most situations that would be the MSVC compiler (with the Windows SDK included in Visual Studio)
- Open CMD within the project root folder
- Run `haxelib run lime test windows` in CMD

#### **For Linux:**
- Install Haxe using your package manager
- Run `haxelib setup` in your terminal
- Install [libraries](#libraries) below
- Clone/Download the source code
- Make sure `g++` command work. If not, install GCC using your package manager
- Open your preferred terminal within the project root folder
- Run `haxelib run lime test linux` in your terminal

#### **Libraries:**  
Run `haxelib install <library name>` replacing `<library name>` with these libraries below:
- `hxcpp`
- `lime`
- `openfl`
- `flixel`

#### **If you're confused:**  
The <a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/tree/v0.2.7.1#build-instructions">original game's compiling instructions</a> should be attiquete. There are also a few helpful resources on YouTube and other places if needed.
