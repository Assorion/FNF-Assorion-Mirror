# ✨ | What is Assorion Engine?

Assorion Engine is effectively the Linux of <a href="https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin">Friday Night Funkin'</a> Engines. 
All original base Friday Night Funkin' code has been replaced with more efficient, optimized code. 

Assorion Engine doesn't have mods folder capabilities planned and it won't be implemented. 
In addition to cutscenes, events, discordRPC, etc, most other features will have to be added yourself, 
although Assorion Engine may have several branches with more features soon.

## ⚡ | Why choose Assorion Engine?

2. Assorion's Code is much better streamlined
3. Assorion takes up less than ~70mb
4. Assorion frequently has many bug fixes and consistently gets improvements compared to the original game and many other engines

# 📝 | Important Notes/RoadMap

  **Notes**   
-	Settings are stored in a `.json` file. (Assets/songs-data/savedata.json) meaning you can externally modify the game settings
-	There has been a complete overhaul of Chartingstate. Therefore, it will probably have new bugs and will be partially confusing at first glance
-	It should be simpler to integrate more characters into a single song. Notes have special player values that make this possible
-	Charts are handled differently to the base game. Absolute positions are used instead of millisecond values. In addition, notes have player values in the chart
-	Assorion Engine based off <a href="https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/releases/tag/v0.2.6">`0.2.6`</a> rsion of the base game
-	Songs and Data folder have been merged into the songs-data folder
